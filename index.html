<p><strong>LGBTQ+ and Christian in Oxford UK?</strong> <emphasis>FIRST
SUNDAY</emphasis> is fellowship for people who are lesbian, gay,
bisexual, trans, or questioning their sexuality (LGBTQ). We're part of
<a href="http://www.saintcolumbas.org/">St Columba's United Reformed Church</a>
in Oxford, UK, and meet there on the first Sunday of the month. You
don't have to be LGBTQ or a Christian to come along.</p>

<p>Our Sunday evening meetings start with some time to catch up over
coffee, pizza and cake. Then we have an activity for the evening which
may be a visiting speaker, a discussion or something crafty, and we
finish the evening with a simple communion.</p>
