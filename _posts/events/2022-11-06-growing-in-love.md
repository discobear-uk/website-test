location: St Columba's United Reformed Church, Oxford

First Sunday has been many things in its 18-year history. Recently,
the teaching, education and entertainment our guest speakers brought
us has inspired us. But now, and in prayer, we need to change; so what
might healthy growth look like for us as a community; for ourselves
and for the others we could reach? Christians should be recognised by
the love they have for each other. What does this look like in
practical terms?

Chrissie is Outreach Worker with Trans and GNC people for St Columba's
United Reformed Church. This is her first opportunity to coach us
forward, co-creating our future together. There'll be time to chat
with coffee and pizza and we'll end the evening with holy communion.
